/*
 * WRI Restoration Marketplace API
 * ### About  This API serves the web and mobile apps for WRI's Restoration Marketplace (AKA TerraMatch).  ### Authentication & Authorisation  JWTs are used for authentication. Upon successful log in a JWT will be provided for you. These expire after 12 hours.  A padlock icon next to an endpoint indicates that it requires an authenticated user. For example:  ![](/images/padlock.png)  ### Requests & Responses  The response bodies documented here will be wrapped in an object adhering to the JSON:API specification.  ### Error Codes  Any errors returned in the body of a response will have a unique code to help identify the type of error. They are:  ``` ACCEPTED, ACTIVE_URL, AFTER, AFTER_OR_EQUAL, ALPHA, ALPHA_DASH, ALPHA_NUM, ARRAY, BEFORE, BEFORE_OR_EQUAL, BETWEEN, BOOLEAN, CARBON_CERTIFICATION_TYPE, CONFIRMED, CONTAIN_LOWER, CONTAIN_NUMBER, CONTAIN_UPPER, CONTINENT, COUNTRY_CODE, CUSTOM, DATE, DATE_EQUALS, DATE_FORMAT, DIFFERENT, DIGITS, DIGITS_BETWEEN, DIMENSIONS, DISTINCT, DOCUMENT_TYPE, EMAIL, ENDS_WITH, EXISTS, FILE, FILLED, FUNDING_BRACKET, FUNDING_SOURCE, GT, GTE, IMAGE, IN, IN_ARRAY, INTEGER, IP, IPV4, IPV6, JSON, LAND_OWNERSHIP, LAND_SIZE, LAND_TYPE, LT, LTE, MAX, MIMES, MIMETYPES, MIN, NOT_IN, NOT_PRESENT, NOT_REGEX, NUMERIC, OTHER_VALUE_PRESENT, OTHER_VALUE_NULL, OTHER_VALUE_STRING, ORGANISATION_CATEGORY, ORGANISATION_TYPE, PRESENT, REGEX, REJECTED_REASON, REPORTING_FREQUENCY, REPORTING_LEVEL, REQUIRED, REQUIRED_IF, REQUIRED_UNLESS, REQUIRED_WITH, REQUIRED_WITH_ALL, REQUIRED_WITHOUT, REQUIRED_WITHOUT_ALL, RESTORATION_GOAL, RESTORATION_METHOD, REVENUE_DRIVER, SAME, SIZE, SOFT_URL, STARTS_WITH, STARTS_WITH_FACEBOOK, STARTS_WITH_TWITTER, STARTS_WITH_INSTAGRAM, STARTS_WITH_LINKEDIN, STRICT_FLOAT, STRING, SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT_GOAL, TIMEZONE, TREE_SPECIES_OWNER, UNIQUE, UPLOADED, URL, UUID, VISIBILITY ```  ### Uploads  Uploads should first be uploaded to the `/uploads` endpoint. Upon success an ID will be returned, this ID is valid for 1 day. Use this ID in your request body to bind the upload to a property.  ### Elevator Videos  Elevator videos can be created by using the `/elevator_videos` endpoint. After creating an elevator video you will be returned an elevator video ID. Use this to check its status. Elevator videos will start off as `processing` and change to `finished` when it has been build. Once the elevator video is built the `upload_id` property will be present, you can use this just like a regular upload and attach it to a pitch's `video` property. Be sure to use the elevator video's `upload_id` property and not its `id` property. An elevator video's status may end up as `errored` or `timed_out` in which case something has gone wrong.  ### Entity Relationship Diagram  ![](/images/erd.png)  ### Units  * All prices are measured in USD * All land is measured in hectares * All time is measured in months  ### Drafts  When creating a draft the `data` property be equal to a string of JSON containing an empty object. You can then manipulate the `data` property with subsequent updates. When updating a draft you will need to use [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) requests to manipulate the `data` property. Operations are relative to the `data` property which means you don't need to preface paths with `/data`.
