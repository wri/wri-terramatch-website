    description: `This story is about the positive impact of 75 young men and women trained as community climate ambassadors. This training empowered the ambassadors on issues taught on topics such as environmental concerns in Sierra Leone: their causes, effects, and mitigation measures. These concerns include deforestation, climate change, pollution, floods, wildfires, etc.

      These women and youths play a critical role in the project—from tree planting and maintenance to community engagement and awareness campaigning. During this period, the project has continued to break stereotypes and make women leaders, especially in restoration activities. Deforestation has been dramatically reduced in the Tokeh Community Dam area with continuous community engagement and environmental education activities. For this reporting period, there have been zero reports of deforestation.
