### Api Fetchers/Hooks Generation


To generate Api types/queries/fetchers/hooks, this repo uses:

- `@openapi-codegen/cli` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapi-codegen/cli)
- `@openapi-codegen/typescript` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapi-codegen/typescript)

#### Usage

In order to generate from the api (whenever there is some backend endpoint/type change) please use this command:

```
yarn generate:api
```

_Can be found in package.json scripts_

This command will fill the `src/generated` folder with a couple of files.

`apiFetcher.ts` will NOT change everytime we re-generate the api, and it's responsible to implement the fetch tool (it uses `fetch` by default but can be changed to something like `axios` if needed).
We can customize the `baseUrl` of where we are fetching from by changing the `const baseUrl` at the top of the file.

`apiContext.ts` will NOT change everytime we re-generate the api, and its responsible to set the global context of api requests.
This is super useful if we want to globally set some headers for each request (such as Authorization header).
It exposes a component hook so we can use other hooks (such as Auth hook or context) to get the logged in token for example and inject it in the global request context.

## Translation ([Transifex Native SDK](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/native)).

Transifex native sdk provides a simple solution for internationalization.

### Usage

When developing, simply utilize the `useT` hook exported by `@transifex/react` to access the `t` function. This function is responsible for fetching the translated version of the text and pushing it to the Transifex cloud. To ensure a text is pushed and translated, enclose it within `t(" ")`. It's worth noting that the CLI command scans the codebase for this pattern, and as a result, storing text in a variable and passing it to `t` is not permitted.

While there are alternative methods of usage, we recommend sticking to the `useT` for consistency across the codebase. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/native).

Here is an exmple of usage

```jsx
import { useT } from "@transifex/react";

const PageContent = () => {
  const t = useT();

  return t("Terramatch");
};
```

### Pull translations

Translations are automatically retrieved, eliminating the need for a manual pull, thanks to the automatic process in `src/i18n.ts`. The `getInitialProps` method in the `_app` file fetches translations during runtime and populates them as props on each page. These props are then internally utilized by Transifex's `t` function. Importantly, this occurs at runtime, eliminating the necessity for a build when translations are uploaded.

### Push translation

Pushing new translations to the Transifex cloud involves just one manual step. You can achieve this by using the `yarn tx:push` command, which leverages `txjs-cli` for seamless execution. To perform a dry run, use the `--dry-run` option for a simulated upload without making actual changes.

For more details about the command-line interface (CLI), please refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/cli).

It's important to note that the setup requires the correct configuration of `TRANSIFEX_TOKEN` and `TRANSIFEX_SECRET` environment variables. Due to the sensitive nature of these variables, they will be securely shared with you via 1Password.

Additionally, consider automating this step using GitHub Actions for increased efficiency.
