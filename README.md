# ðŸŒ² Terramatch Web Platform ðŸŒ²

### Storybook
We host the `staging` build of Storybook on [Github Pages](https://wri.github.io/wri-terramatch-website/)

### Installation

```
// Install dependencies
yarn
// Run app (dev)
yarn dev
```

### Api Fetchers/Hooks Generation

To generate Api types/queries/fetchers/hooks, this repo uses:

- `@openapi-codegen/cli` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapi-codegen/cli)
- `@openapi-codegen/typescript` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapi-codegen/typescript)

#### Usage

In order to generate from the v1/2 api (whenever there is some backend endpoint/type change) please use this command:

```
yarn generate:api
```

_Can be found in package.json scripts_

This command will fill the `src/generated` folder with a couple of files.

`apiFetcher.ts` will NOT change everytime we re-generate the api, and it's responsible to implement the fetch tool (it uses `fetch` by default but can be changed to something like `axios` if needed).
We can customize the `baseUrl` of where we are fetching from by changing the `const baseUrl` at the top of the file.

`apiContext.ts` will NOT change everytime we re-generate the api, and its responsible to set the global context of api requests.
This is super useful if we want to globally set some headers for each request (such as Authorization header).
It exposes a component hook so we can use other hooks (such as Auth hook or context) to get the logged in token for example and inject it in the global request context.

##### v3 API
The V3 API has a different API layer, but the generation is similar: 
```
yarn generate:services
```

When adding a new **service** app to the v3 API:
* In `constants.environment.ts, define the service URL for all ENVIRONMENTS.
* In `openapi-codegen.config.ts`, add the new service name to the `SERVICES` object (e.g. `foo-service`). 
* This will generate a new target, which needs to be added to `package.json`:
  * Under scripts, add `"generate:fooService": "npm run generate:fooService"`
  * Under the `"generate:services"` script, add the new service: `"generate:services": "npm run generate:userService && npm run generate:fooService`
* After running `yarn generate:fooService` the first time:
  * open the generated `fooServiceFetcher.ts` and modify it to match `userServiceFetcher.ts`. 
    * This file does not get regenerated after the first time, and so it can utilize the same utilities 
      for interfacing with the redux API layer / connection system that the other v3 services use.
  * open `apiSlice.ts` and update the `RESOURCES` const and `ApiResource` type to reference the newly 
    generated resources constants from the newly generated service constants file.
* Follow directions below for all namespaces in the new service

When adding a new **namespace** to the V3 API:
* In `generated/v3/utils.ts`, add namespace -> service URL mapping to `V3_NAMESPACES`

### Connections
Connections are a **declarative** way for components to get access to the data from the cached API
layer that they need. This system is under development, and the current documentation about it is 
[available in Confluence](https://gfw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TerraMatch/pages/1423147024/Connections)

Note for Storybook: Because multiple storybook components can be on the page at the same time that each
have their own copy of the redux store, the Connection utilities `loadConnection` (typically used 
via `connectionLoaded` in `connectionShortcuts.ts`) and `connectionSelector` will not work as expected
in storybook stories. This is because those utilities rely on `ApiSlice.redux` and `ApiSlice.apiDataStore`, 
and in the case of storybook, those will end up with only the redux store from the last component on the
page. Regular connection use through `useConnection` will work because it gets the store from the 
Provider in the redux component tree in that case. 

When building storybook stories for components that rely on connections via `useConnection`, make sure
that the story is provided with a store that has all dependent data already loaded. See `testStore.tsx`'s
`buildStore` builder, and `Navbar.stories.tsx` for example usage.

## Translation ([Transifex Native SDK](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/native)).

Transifex native sdk provides a simple solution for internationalization.

### Usage

When developing, simply utilize the `useT` hook exported by `@transifex/react` to access the `t` function. This function is responsible for fetching the translated version of the text and pushing it to the Transifex cloud. To ensure a text is pushed and translated, enclose it within `t(" ")`. It's worth noting that the CLI command scans the codebase for this pattern, and as a result, storing text in a variable and passing it to `t` is not permitted.

While there are alternative methods of usage, we recommend sticking to the `useT` for consistency across the codebase. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/native).

Here is an exmple of usage

```jsx
import { useT } from "@transifex/react";

const PageContent = () => {
  const t = useT();

  return t("Terramatch");
};
```

### Pull translations

Translations are automatically retrieved, eliminating the need for a manual pull, thanks to the automatic process in `src/i18n.ts`. The `getInitialProps` method in the `_app` file fetches translations during runtime and populates them as props on each page. These props are then internally utilized by Transifex's `t` function. Importantly, this occurs at runtime, eliminating the necessity for a build when translations are uploaded.

### Push translation

Pushing new translations to the Transifex cloud involves just one manual step. You can achieve this by using the `yarn tx:push` command, which leverages `txjs-cli` for seamless execution. To perform a dry run, use the `--dry-run` option for a simulated upload without making actual changes.

For more details about the command-line interface (CLI), please refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.transifex.com/docs/cli).

It's important to note that the setup requires the correct configuration of `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSIFEX_TOKEN` and `TRANSIFEX_SECRET` environment variables. Due to the sensitive nature of these variables, they will be securely shared with you via 1Password.

Additionally, consider automating this step using GitHub Actions for increased efficiency.
